 PREPROCESSOR WARNING MESSAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***WARNING: There are 407 warning messages in the data (.dat) file.  Please
            check the data file for possible errors in the input file.



***WARNING: In step 1, some facet thicknesses for general contact were reduced
            from the parent element or specified values due to a large
            thickness compared to facet dimensions.  The most significant
            thickness scaling factor was 0.63022 for a facet on parent element
            34 of instance TRIANGLE-1.  An element set named
            "WarnElemGContThickReduce" has been created to locate the regions
            of reduced thickness.


***WARNING: In step 1, portions of main surfaces in the general contact domain
            have been tied together.  Joining disconnected surfaces with *TIE
            does not alter the surface connectivity and results in a seam in
            the contact surface.  The nodes along the tied surface perimeters
            have been added to the node set named  "WarnNodePerimTieSeam".

  INFORMATION REGARDING INITIAL CONTACT OVERCLOSURES FOR NEWLY DEFINED GENERAL
  CONTACT INTERACTIONS IN STEP 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***WARNING: 8 secondary nodes are pinched between tied surfaces. This is most
            likely a modeling error and should be corrected before continuing
            the analysis. To help identify the pinched nodes the nset
            WarnNodePinchedTiedSurf has been created. Check the message file
            for more detailed information.


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 154 initial node-face overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for node-face contact is 0.54791 at node 35 of
  instance PART-1-2 and face SPOS of element 185 of instance TRIANGLE-2.


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 42 initial edge-edge overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for edge-edge contact is 0.54771 between the
  edge defined by nodes 70 and 71 of instance TRIANGLE-2 and the edge defined
  by nodes 34 and 35 of instance PART-1-2


  Maximum initial contact adjustment is: 0.66441 at node 67 of instance
  TRIANGLE-1.


  44 node-face overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created. Check the message file for more
  detailed information.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 0.45874 at node 2 of instance TRIANGLE-2
  and face SNEG of element 25 of instance PART-1-2.


  7 edge-edge overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets. To
  help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created. Check the message file for more
  detailed information.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 0.45456 between the edge defined by nodes
  17 and 3 of instance PART-1-2 and the edge defined by nodes 2 and 18 of
  instance TRIANGLE-2


***WARNING: 34 secondary nodes have been found to be coincident with the
            reference plane of double-sided elements after the completion of
            the initial overclosure procedure (88 were detected in the
            original model). It may be neccessary to manually adjust the
            configuration of these nodes (e.g. via the *CONTACT CLEARANCE
            ASSIGNMENT option). These secondary nodes have been added to the
            node set WarnNodeCoincidRefPlane. Check the message file for more
            detailed information.


  More detailed information on initial overclosures can be found in the
  message (.msg) file.


***NOTE: You can view the deformed configuration due to the resolution of
         initial overclosures.  In increment 0, draw the deformed shape or
         draw a symbol plot of vector displacements.
