***WARNING: The nodes in node set WarnNodeMassAugment are involved in
            constraints that have to be solved using the implicit constraint
            solver. Each of these constraints involve nodes that have masses
            that are highly mismatched, hence the implicit constraint solver
            may encounter convergence problems. It is strongly recommended
            that the analysis be run in double=constraint mode. To improve the
            conditioning of the system, the masses of the nodes included in
            this node set have been augmented by small amounts. The additional
            mass will almost never affect the solution significantly except
            for strongly dynamic analyses.


***WARNING:  The total augmented nodal masses as a percentage of total model
            mass is 7.00691E-07 percent.

***WARNING: In element 51 of instance PART-1-3 the ratio of deformation speed
            to wave speed is 0.40000 at increment 24861. See the message file
            for further information.


***ERROR: The ratio of deformation speed to wave speed exceeds 1.0000 in at
          least one element. This usually indicates an error with the model
          definition. Additional diagnostic information may be found in the
          message file.


The following checklist may be helpful in diagnosing the error:

    1. Check contact definitions for problems such as excessive initial
       overclosure or unrealistic tied definition between contact pairs.
       A vector plot of velocities or accelerations will usually help to
       identify contact problems.

    2. Check stiffness (elastic modulus) and mass (density) definitions for
       consistent units and verify that the combination is reasonable.

    3. Check for poor mesh definition.

    4. Check the boundary conditions for an excessive loading rate. The
       *DIAGNOSTICS, DEFORMATION SPEED CHECK=DETAIL option may be used to obtain
       detailed diagnostics information.

    5. Check the current status of the structure to see if it has
       totally failed.

    6. A dashpot or a very stiff spring may cause the analysis to go unstable.
       The *DYNAMIC, DIRECT option may be used to control the time increment
       directly.


***ERROR: The fatal error will generate a new field output in the last
          increment. All variables applicable to the current procedure and
          material type(s) will be written to the output database.
