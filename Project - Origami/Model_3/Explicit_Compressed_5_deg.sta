 PREPROCESSOR WARNING MESSAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***WARNING: There are 405 warning messages in the data (.dat) file.  Please
            check the data file for possible errors in the input file.



***WARNING: In step 1, portions of main surfaces in the general contact domain
            have been tied together.  Joining disconnected surfaces with *TIE
            does not alter the surface connectivity and results in a seam in
            the contact surface.  The nodes along the tied surface perimeters
            have been added to the node set named  "WarnNodePerimTieSeam".

 STABLE TIME INCREMENT INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  The stable time increment estimate for each element is based on
  linearization about the initial state.


   Initial time increment = 3.10702E-06

   Statistics for all elements:
      Mean = 3.10701E-06
      Standard deviation = 7.58090E-09

***WARNING: Boundary conditions have been prescribed at nodes belonging to
            rigid bodies but are not rigid body reference nodes. Boundary
            conditions on rigid body nodes other than the rigid body reference
            node do not constrain the motion of the rigid body. A node set
            named "WarnNodeBcAtRbSecondaryNode" containing the problematic
            secondary nodes is created to help the user locate the error and
            modify the input definition.

  INFORMATION REGARDING INITIAL CONTACT OVERCLOSURES FOR NEWLY DEFINED GENERAL
  CONTACT INTERACTIONS IN STEP 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 34 initial node-face overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for node-face contact is 0.30000 at node 72 of
  instance PART-3-1 and face SNEG of element 24 of instance PART-2-1.


  No initial edge-edge overclosures found.


  No nodal position adjustments have been made.


  34 node-face overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created. Check the message file for more
  detailed information.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 0.30000 at node 72 of instance PART-3-1
  and face SNEG of element 24 of instance PART-2-1.


  No edge-edge overclosures left unresolved.


***WARNING: 34 secondary nodes have been found to be coincident with the
            reference plane of double-sided elements after the completion of
            the initial overclosure procedure (34 were detected in the
            original model). It may be neccessary to manually adjust the
            configuration of these nodes (e.g. via the *CONTACT CLEARANCE
            ASSIGNMENT option). These secondary nodes have been added to the
            node set WarnNodeCoincidRefPlane. Check the message file for more
            detailed information.


  More detailed information on initial overclosures can be found in the
  message (.msg) file.


***NOTE: You can view the deformed configuration due to the resolution of
         initial overclosures.  In increment 0, draw the deformed shape or
         draw a symbol plot of vector displacements.
